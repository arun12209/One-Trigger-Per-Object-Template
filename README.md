# Apex Trigger Template

# Benefits of using one trigger per object template

* **Control over order of execution**: This pattern allows you to control the order of execution.
* **Reusability**: When you write your logic in apex class then it can be reused outside of trigger as well. For example in the lightning component controller, test class, batch class, visualforce page controller, etc.
* **Elegance**: This design pattern elevates the code’s elegance, organization, and modularity.
